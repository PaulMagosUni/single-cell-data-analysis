| Entropy | Suppose we are given $l$ categories, while the clustering method generates $k$ clusters. $Entropy = - \frac{1}{n \log_2 l} \sum_{q=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^l n_q^j \log_2 \frac{n_q^j}{n_q}$, where $n$ is the total number of samples; $n_{q}$ is the total number of samples in cluster $q$ ($1 \leq q \leq k$); $n_{q}^{j}$ is the number of samples in cluster $q$ that belongs to original class $j$ ($1 \leq j \leq l$) | $[0, ]$ | ❌ | [🔗](https://rdrr.io/cran/NMF/man/purity.html) |
| Purity | Suppose we are given $l$ categories, while the clustering method generates $k$ clusters. The purity of the clustering with respect to the known categories is given by: $Purity = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{q=1}^k \max_{1 \leq j \leq l} n_q^j$, where $n$ is the total number of samples; $n_{q}^{j}$ is the number of samples in cluster $q$ that belongs to original class $j$ ($1 \leq j \leq l$). | $[0,1]$ | ✅ | [🔗](https://rdrr.io/cran/NMF/man/purity.html) |
| Silhouette | $s = \frac{b_i - a_i}{max(a_i, b_i)}$ where $a_i$ is the average distance of object $i$ to all other objects in its cluster and $b_i$ is the minimum of the average distances from $i$ to all the objects in another cluster | $[-1, 1]$ | ✅ |  [🔗](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/cluster/html/silhouette.html) (averaged, computed on PCA matrix, # components chosen based on explained variance ratio) |
| Normalized Mutual Information | A normalization of the Mutual Information (MI) score. MI is a function that measures the agreement of the two assignments, ignoring permutations. Specifically, if $\|U_i\|$ is the number of samples in cluster $U_i$ and $\|V_j\|$ the number of samples in cluster $V_j$, $MI(U, V) = \sum_{i=1}^{\|U\|}{\sum_{j=1}^{\|V\|}{\frac{\|U_i \cap V_j\|}{N}log\frac{N\|U_i \cap V_j\|}{\|U_i\|\|V_j\|}}}$ | $[0, 1]$ | ✅ | [🔗](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/aricode/html/NMI.html) (variant 'sum') |
| Adjusted Rand Index | Computes a similarity measure between two clusterings by considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings. Specifically, $ARI = \frac{(RI - \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(RI))}{(max(RI) - \mathop{\mathbb{E}}(RI))}$, $RI = \frac{a+b}{C_{2}^{n_{samples}}}$ where if $C$ is a ground truth class assignment and $K$ the clustering, $a$ is the number of pairs of elements that are in the same set in $C$ and in the same set in $K$, $b$ the number of pairs of elements that are in different sets in $C$ and in different sets in $K$, $C_{2}^{n_{samples}}$ the total number of possible pairs in the dataset | $[-0.5, 1]$ | ✅ | [🔗](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/pdfCluster/html/adj.rand.index.html) |
